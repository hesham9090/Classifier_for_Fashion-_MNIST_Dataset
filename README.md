# Classifier_for_Fashion-_MNIST_Dataset
Use Deep Neural networks to built a classifier for Fashion MNIST Dataset using 2 RELU layers and 1 softmax. Experiment with this model using these scenarios for the hidden layers and plot the history graph in each scenario and write a conclusion about the best structure to use in this problem and about why some scnearios have bad perfromance here (if any) Scenarios: 
1. Use 2 tanh layers       
2. Use 2 linear layers       
3. Use 1 RELU layer      
4. use 2 RELu layers with # nodes = 150,50 respectively
